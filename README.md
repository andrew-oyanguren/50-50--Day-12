### General Information
This project was very easy for me and my abilities right now. I created several cards and added an active class that I was able to toggle using the foreach method on each elements parent node.
This was an important Exercise for me, as I had recently been turned down from 2 interviews that I was a finalist in, and I needed to pick myself back up and get back to coding. This was the first project that I did, and it was a nice refresher.
